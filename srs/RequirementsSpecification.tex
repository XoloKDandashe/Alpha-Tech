	\section{Introduction}
			

		\subsection{Purpose}
			The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and design specifications of the SmartCard system. This document provides a detailed explanation of system constraints, interfaces and interactions with other external applications. This document serves as a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team and will also provide a detailed description of the system for clients and any other interested party.


		\subsection{Scope}
The SmartCard system is a mobile-based application that is used to transfer business data from one device to another using either NFC or QR code scanner. A virtual business card will be generated for the user using the information the user signed up with and will then be transmitted with a single tap using the NFC too available on their smart device. Alternatively the smart device’s camera will be used to scan the QR code on another device. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.

				\end{itemize}
				
			
				\subsection{Constraints}
            
				
				$\bullet$\  The constraints on the project are related to the provision of hardware resources to implement and test. Our project is coded mainly in android studio which may require a lot of time when building. At present we are using laptops                                 				that are only on 2/4 gig RAM running intel inside processor which can be very slow when building a project during testing. For better perfomance and more efficient building, laptops that use atleast 6gig of RAM and a i5 processor would be 							beneficial.\par

                                	$\bullet$\ The mobile devices that are going to run our application are constrained by NFC technology. The phone you're using to run the application needs to have NFC technology on it. To overcome this particular constraint, will make use of QR codes 					as a substitute to mobile devices that do not contain NFC technology on them. 

                                	$\bullet$\ Normal business cards without any NFC chips embedded in them will also be a constraint when using the system. Because these cards don't have NFC chips, we are going to have  to scan them to our sytem and embed a QR code on them so 					they can also be used.

                                	$\bullet$\  Another constraint is that our application will only work on android phones so people that use other operating systems on their mobile devices won't have acces to it.  
				
				\subsubsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
				
				 $\bullet$\ It assumed that the user is familiar/has basic knowledge with mobile applications  and also familiar with handling the keyboard on the phone for registering and login in operations.

                                 	 $\bullet$\ It is assumed that the user will have mobile data on their phone when using our location service because Google maps will be integrated in our application which requires mobile data/ WI-FI to work.

                                	 $\bullet$\ User Manual will be provided for the application

	\section{Specific Requirements}
				\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
						Since the prototype will  be developed for Android systems and later on expanded to iOS ,this part of the specification will primarily assume the Android OS is the operating system for the system.
						\subsubsection{Interfaces} 
					         The app will require system privileges to make use of certain features and information provided by the Android OS.
						 \begin{itemize}
							      \item \textbf{NFC}\\
					        The system will be dependant on the device's NFC system services to be able to read the nfc smart card and also send                              business cards via NFC to another device.Access to this feature forms the backbone of the app as most of the subsystems are dependant on it.
								\item \textbf{Camera}\\
						If a mobile device does not have a NFC chip our app will use the camera on the phone to scan a QR code .
						\end{itemize}
						\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
						    There will be a unified user interface which can be broken down into 4 subsystems all of which will be displayed 		           simultaneously. The 5th subsystem (Searching) will tie into the navigational subsystem \\
                                                  \begin{itemize}
					        \item \textbf{Send Card}\\
						Users will use the Send Card subsystem to Send thier business card information to another device using NFC or a QR code that has been generated .The user will select the option they want ,if NFC is selected the system will check whether the device has a NFC and if its on after that 	it will attempt to send the business card to a receiver and will display a popup showing whether the transfer was succesfull or not.				       

						\item \textbf{Recieve Card}\\
						Users will use the receive card subsystem to receive a business card from a sender which might be a smartcard or another device either through NFC or scanning the QR code.

						\item \textbf{Update Details}\\
						This will give the user the ability to update all thier information .
						
						\item \textbf{Manage Cards}\\
						Users and Administrators will interact with the update subsystem with the administrators having more privillages.The users will be able to view their saved cards while the admin will be able to view cards ,write ,update and delete information from a smartcard.

                                                 
                                              
                                                \item \textbf{Searching}\\
						This will be a minor add-on to the Manage Cards Subsystem which will allow users to search for business cards they have saved on their device.
                                                  \end{itemize}
                                              \subsubsection{System Interfaces}
							\begin{itemize}
    						    \item \textbf{An android phone } \\
    						    Android devices are the most commonly used devices, so development will initially focus on these devices. There are android devices with many varying specifications, but we will focus on newer models in order to simplify the prototype. \\
    
    						\end{itemize}
                                               \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
        					\begin{itemize}
        					    \item \textbf{Android NFC API}\\
        					    This would be our tool of choice as it covers the basis for sending and receiving data through NFC ,which our system requires for successful implementation.
						 \item \textbf{Google Maps API}\\
        					    This would be our tool of choice as it covers the basis for navigation which will be an add on at a later stage for our system.
        					    \item \textbf{Other}\\
        					    Other libraries and API's will then be added to the project later to cater for any extensions once our core features have been implemented.
        					\end{itemize}
                                              \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
    						\begin{itemize}
						  \item \textbf{NFC chip} \\
						The nfc chip on the phone and the smartcard are the ones to be used for the transfer of information.
    						    \item \textbf{Camera} \\
    						    We will use the Camera if a phone does not have a NFC chip to read a QR code that consist of the business card information . \\
						\end{itemize}
						\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
						\begin{itemize}
    						    
    						    \item \textbf{Near field communication (NFC)} \\
    						    We will make use NFC to write and read data from a NFC smart card.    						    
    						  
    						    \item \textbf{E-mail} \\
    						    We will use email for registration and login, which will then allow us to identify different users.  \\
    						\end{itemize}
