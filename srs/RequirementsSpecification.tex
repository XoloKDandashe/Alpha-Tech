				\subsection{Constraints}
            
				
				The constraints on the project are related to the provision of hardware resources to implement and test. 				 Our project is coded
				mainly in android studio which may require a lot of time when building. At present we are using laptops                                 that are only on 2/4 gig RAM
                                running intel inside processor which can be very slow when building a project during testing. For better                                 perfomance and more efficient
                                building, laptops that use atleast 6gig of RAM and a i5 processor would be beneficial.\par

                                The mobile devices that are going to run our application are constrained by NFC technology. The phone                                   you're using to run the application needs to have NFC technology on it. To overcome this particular                                     constraint, will make use of QR codes as a substitute to mobile devices that do not contain NFC                                         technology on them. 

                                Normal business cards without any NFC chips embedded in them will also be a constraint when using the                                   system. Because these cards don't have NFC chips, we are going to have  to scan them to our sytem and                                   embed a QR code on them so they can also be used.

                                Another constraint is that our application will only work on android phones so people that use other                                     operating systems on their mobile devices won't have acces to it.  
				
				\subsubsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
				
				 It assumed that the user is familiar/has basic knowledge with mobile applications  and also familiar                                    with handling the keyboard on the phone for registering and login in operations.

                                 It is assumed that the user will have mobile data on their phone when using our location service                                        because Google maps will be integrated in our application which requires mobile data/ WI-FI to work.

                                 User Manual will be provided for the application
