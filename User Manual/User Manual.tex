	\section{System Overview}
	The SmartCard system is a mobile-based application that is used to transfer business data from one device to another using either NFC or QR-Code scanner.The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services. 
	
	\section{System Configuration}
	The SmartCard system operates on mobile devices with Android operating system. It is compatible with
	Android 4,1 (jelly bean) API 16 and higher versions. The application requires connection to Internet in order to
	save data to database. A virtual business card will be generated for the user using the information the user signed up with and will then be transmitted with a single tap using the NFC too available on their smart device. Alternatively the smart device’s camera will be used to scan the QR code on another device. After
	installation on the device, SmartCard can be used immediately without any further configuration.
	\section{Installation}
	The most recent apk has been made available on our GIT repository for installation on a device. 
	
	Download the apk from the website and install on your device. For specific instruction on how to install application on specific device refer to
	device’s manual.
	
	Alternatively the application should be available for download and install on google play store.
